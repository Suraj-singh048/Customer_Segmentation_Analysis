# Student Acquisition Channel Segmentation and Analysis

## Goal of this Workbook

The goal of this analysis is to explore if the acquisition channel (e.g., Twitter, Instagram, etc.) has any correlation with how much students engage with the learning content, as measured by metrics like `minutes watched` and `Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)`. Specifically, we aim to answer questions like:
- Are Twitter (X) groups more or less likely to study than those from Instagram?
- Are students from the US more likely to have heard about the program through friends or social media?

By identifying trends across different customer groups, this analysis helps inform marketing strategies, enabling better resource allocation in future campaigns.

## About the Data

This dataset contains student information for over 3,800 individuals from the 365 program. The data has been preprocessed and anonymized to ensure privacy.

## Libraries Used

The analysis utilizes the following Python libraries:
- **NumPy** and **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** for clustering (K-means, Hierarchical Clustering)
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** for visualization
- **SciPy** for statistical analysis

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import dendrogram, linkage
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Data Overview
The dataset is loaded and an initial inspection is done using `df.head()` and `df.describe()`. The `df_segmentation` DataFrame is created as a copy of the original to preserve the data for further manipulation.

```python
df = pd.read_csv('customer_segmentation_data.csv')
df.describe()
```

### Handling Missing Data
Missing values are checked and handled by filling them with zeros using `fillna(0)`.

### Correlation Heatmap
A correlation heatmap is generated to explore the relationships between numerical variables like `minutes watched`, `CLV`, and the newly created dummy variables for `channel` and `region`.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 9))
sns.heatmap(df_segmentation.corr(), annot=True, cmap='RdBu', vmin=-1, vmax=1)
```

### Data Visualization
A scatter plot visualizing the relationship between `minutes watched` and `CLV` is created to examine potential trends in the data.

```python
plt.scatter(df_segmentation['minutes watched'], df_segmentation['CLV'])
```

### Creating Dummy Variables
Categorical variables (`channel` and `region`) are converted into dummy variables using `pd.get_dummies()`. This allows us to perform clustering on the data after it has been transformed into numerical form.

```python
df_dummies = pd.get_dummies(df['channel'])
df_segmentation = df_segmentation.join(df_dummies)
```

## Model Implementation

### Standardization
Before applying clustering algorithms, the data is standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 for each feature using `StandardScaler`.

```python
scaler = StandardScaler()
segmentation_std = scaler.fit_transform(df_segmentation)
```

### Hierarchical Clustering
Hierarchical clustering is applied to the standardized data using the `ward` method. A dendrogram is plotted to visualize the merging of clusters.

```python
hier_clust = linkage(segmentation_std, method='ward')
dendrogram(hier_clust, truncate_mode='level', p=5)
```

### K-means Clustering
K-means clustering is used to partition the data into distinct clusters. The optimal number of clusters is determined using the "Elbow Method," and clustering is performed with 8 clusters.

```python
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=8, random_state=42)
kmeans.fit(segmentation_std)
```

## Model Interpretation and Results

### Cluster Profiling
Once clustering is complete, each cluster's profile is analyzed by calculating the mean values of each feature within each cluster. These profiles help understand the key characteristics of each segment.

```python
df_segm_analysis = df_segm_kmeans.groupby(['Segment']).mean()
```

### Segment Labeling
Each cluster is given a human-readable label, representing a specific group of students based on their acquisition channel and engagement behaviors.

```python
df_segm_kmeans['Labels'] = df_segm_kmeans['Segment'].map({0: 'Instagram Explorers', 1: 'LinkedIn Networkers', ...})
```

### Visualizing Segments
A scatter plot is generated to visualize the clusters, with different colors representing different segments.

```python
sns.scatterplot(x='CLV', y='minutes watched', hue='Labels', data=df_segm_kmeans)
```

## Conclusion

This workbook analyzes the relationships between student acquisition channels and engagement metrics like `minutes watched` and `CLV`. Through clustering techniques like hierarchical and K-means clustering, we identified distinct segments of students with differing behaviors. This segmentation can provide actionable insights for marketing strategies, helping to target the most engaged and profitable customer segments more effectively.

## Next Steps

- **Refinement of Segments:** Further tuning of the clustering algorithms and exploration of different features can refine these segments.
- **Marketing Campaigns:** Based on the segments, tailored marketing campaigns can be developed to better engage students from each segment.
